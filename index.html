    <h1>Cats</h1>
    <p>Cats are a common pet animal all over the world. There are many different breeds - including some without fur!</p>
    <p>Cats can have wildly different personalities - some are sweet and cuddly, some prefer to be left alone. Almost all of them object to belly rubs though.</p>
